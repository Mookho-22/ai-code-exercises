# README Documentation Exercise

## Project Context
You've been assigned to create documentation for a new open-source project called "TaskFlow" - a minimalist task management API. The project has great functionality but lacks proper documentation, making it difficult for new users and contributors to get started.

## Exercise Goal
Create a comprehensive README.md file for the TaskFlow project that helps users understand what the project does, how to set it up, and how to use its features.

## Project Description
TaskFlow is a REST API for task management with the following features:

1. Task CRUD operations with priorities and due dates
2. Project organization for tasks
3. User authentication and authorization
4. Task assignment to users
5. Automated reminders for upcoming tasks
6. Activity logging and reporting

The project is built with:
- Node.js and Express.js for the backend API
- MongoDB for data storage
- JWT for authentication
- Jest for testing

## Exercise Requirements
Create a README.md that includes:

1. Project title, logo (optional), and brief description
2. Installation instructions
3. Configuration steps
4. API documentation overview
5. Examples of basic usage
6. Development setup for contributors
7. Testing procedures
8. License information
9. Contact details for the maintainers

## Tips for Success
- Structure your README logically - what would a new user need to know first?
- Use markdown formatting effectively for readability
- Include code examples for common use cases
- Consider adding visual elements like screenshots or diagrams
- Balance between brevity and completeness
