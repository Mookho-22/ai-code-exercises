# API Documentation Challenge

## Project Context
WeatherNow is a weather data service providing real-time and forecast weather information through a REST API. The API has been developed and is functional, but lacks proper documentation, making it difficult for developers to integrate it into their applications.

## Exercise Goal
Create comprehensive API documentation for the WeatherNow API that will enable developers to understand and effectively use all available endpoints.

## API Description
The WeatherNow API provides the following core functionality:
1. Current weather data for any location by city name, coordinates, or zip code
2. 7-day weather forecasts
3. Historical weather data for up to 30 days in the past
4. Weather alerts and warnings for specified locations
5. Air quality information
6. Authentication using API keys
7. Rate limiting based on subscription tier

## Exercise Requirements
Your API documentation should include:

1. Authentication guide
2. Base URL and versioning information
3. Detailed endpoint documentation including:
   - HTTP method
   - Path
   - Path and query parameters
   - Request body structure (when applicable)
   - Response format and status codes
   - Example requests and responses
4. Rate limits and usage restrictions
5. Error codes and troubleshooting
6. Implementation examples in at least two programming languages

## Tips for Success
- Consider using a standardized documentation format like OpenAPI/Swagger
- Include real-world examples that demonstrate common use cases
- Structure your documentation in a logical order, from basic to advanced functionality
- Pay special attention to parameters that might not be self-explanatory
- Include error handling guidelines

## Resources
- The 'project' folder contains sample code files and API information to help you understand the endpoints
- You may use AI tools to help you generate clear examples and descriptions
