# Merge Sort Debugging Exercise

This exercise is designed to help you practice debugging skills with a JavaScript implementation of the merge sort algorithm.

## Overview

The repository contains:
- `merge_sort.js`: An implementation of merge sort with a bug
- `tests/merge_sort.test.js`: Jest tests that demonstrate the bug

## Requirements

- Node.js (any recent version)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Setup

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Code

You can run the merge sort implementation directly:

```bash
node merge_sort.js
```

However, this won't show much output, as the file only defines the functions without executing them.

## Running the Tests

Run the test suite to see the bug in action:

```bash
npm test
```

Or run tests in watch mode to see changes as you fix the code:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

The tests will fail or time out due to the bug in the merge sort implementation.
