# Code Reviews with AI

## Overview

This exercise helps you practice using AI to improve your code through different review strategies. You'll work with code examples in Python, JavaScript, and Java to discover how AI can serve different roles in the development process - from independent reviewer to pre-submission polisher to real-time programming partner.

## Exercise Options

Choose one of these code examples:

1. **Python Data Visualization Function**: A data processing and visualization utility with various improvement opportunities
2. **JavaScript User Authentication Utility**: A web application authentication module with several issues
3. **Java File Management Class**: A file utility class with quality and design challenges

## Exercise Instructions

1. Choose one of the provided code examples
2. Apply the prompts from the "Pre-submission Code Review" scenario:
   - Project Standards Alignment
   - Reviewer Perspective Simulation
   - Documentation and Comment Enhancement
3. For each prompt, document:
   - What issues or improvements the AI identified
   - Any unexpected insights
   - What changes you would make based on the feedback
4. Compare the feedback from different strategies
5. Implement at least three key improvements based on the feedback
6. Reflect on how you could incorporate these approaches into your workflow

## Code Examples Detail

### 1. Python Data Visualization Function (src/data_visualization.py)

A dashboard generation function that processes sales data and creates visualizations using Plotly. Issues include:
- Import placement and organization
- Error handling and validation improvements
- Documentation gaps
- Performance optimization opportunities

### 2. JavaScript User Authentication Utility (src/user_auth.js)

A session-based authentication system with token management and password validation. Issues include:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Error handling gaps
- Storage management challenges
- Structure and organization improvements

### 3. Java File Management Class (src/FileManager.java)

A utility class for file operations including reading, writing, and archiving. Issues include:
- Resource management concerns
- Exception handling patterns
- Potential thread safety issues
- Design inconsistencies

## Prompting Strategies

### Pre-submission Code Polishing
- **Prompt 1: Project Standards Alignment** - Ensure code follows project/team standards
- **Prompt 2: Reviewer Perspective Simulation** - Anticipate feedback from different reviewer types
- **Prompt 3: Documentation and Comment Enhancement** - Improve code documentation

## Workshop Worksheet

Use this structure to document your findings during the exercise:

### Code Selection
- Selected code: [Python/JavaScript/Java]
- Brief description of what the code does

### Prompt Results
For each prompt:
- Issues identified (list 3-5)
- Unexpected insights (list 1-2)
- Planned improvements (list 3)

### Comparison of Prompts
- Most valuable prompt and why
- Types of issues found by multiple prompts
- Types of issues found by only one prompt
- Any contradictory feedback between prompts

### Implementation Plan
- Top 3 improvements to implement
- How you would prioritize these changes
- Additional dependencies or resources needed

### Workflow Integration
- How you would integrate AI code review strategies into your normal workflow
- Potential barriers to adoption
- How these approaches might complement human code reviews
