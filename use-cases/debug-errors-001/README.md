# Exercise: Error Diagnosis Challenge

[Instructions](https://dev.ai.wethinkco.de/ai-software/ai-use-cases/exercises/exercise-debug-errors-001/)

This contains the starter code for the various error-prone code used in the exercise. Code is available for three languages:

- [Java](java/README.md)
- [Python](python/README.md)
- [Javascript](javascript/README.md)

_Note that the starter code is by no means brilliant or optimized code. It is intentionally created to show the errors you must debug and fix via the various AI prompts and techniques you are going to learn in this course._
