# Data Transformation Library - Documentation Challenge

## Project Context
DataFlow is a JavaScript utility library designed to help data analysts and front-end developers transform, validate, and manipulate data from various sources before visualization or storage. The library aims to simplify common data operations with a consistent and flexible API.

## Feature Context
The `transformData` function is a core utility that:
- Processes array data through a pipeline of transformations
- Provides filtering capabilities to remove null/undefined values
- Optionally adds timestamps to track when data was processed
- Limits result sets for pagination or preview purposes
- Accepts custom transformation functions for specialized processing

## Technical Context
- Used in both browser and Node.js environments
- Serves as a utility across several data-heavy applications
- Handles arrays with potentially thousands of elements
- Processes data from multiple sources, including APIs, CSV imports, and databases
- Used by both technical and semi-technical team members

## Documentation Needs
- New developers struggle to understand all available options
- Some edge cases are not documented (e.g., handling empty arrays or non-array inputs)
- Examples are needed for common use cases
- Parameter descriptions lack detail about valid values and defaults
- No clear documentation of return value structure

## User Stories
1. As a front-end developer, I need to understand how to transform API data for visualization
2. As a data analyst, I want to clean and prepare data sets with minimal custom code
3. As a new team member, I need comprehensive documentation to use the library correctly
4. As a QA engineer, I need to understand expected behaviors for edge cases

## System Requirements
- JavaScript ES6+
- Works in both Node.js and browser environments
- No external dependencies
