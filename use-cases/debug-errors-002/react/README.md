# Movie Database React App - Debugging Challenge

## Project Context
CineView is a movie information web application built with React, designed to showcase details about popular films. The application provides users with a curated list of movies, including information such as titles, directors, and release years.

## Feature Context
The MovieList component is responsible for:
- Displaying a collection of movie cards in a grid layout
- Rendering individual movie details in a consistent format
- Supporting interactive elements such as clicking for additional information
- Maintaining optimal rendering performance for large collections

## Technical Context
- React 18.2.0 application using functional components
- Renders dynamic lists of data from API endpoints
- UI receives warnings in the developer console about missing keys
- App will need to scale to potentially display hundreds of movies
- Performance issues may arise when rendering large lists

## Error Context
- The development console shows React key warnings
- React key warnings often indicate potential performance issues or rendering bugs
- Missing keys in lists can cause problems with component updates and re-renders
- There are potential ID conflicts in the sample data that might cause unexpected behavior

2. As a web developer, I want the application to follow React best practices for optimal performance
3. As a user with accessibility needs, I want the movie list to work correctly with screen readers
4. As a product owner, I want the movie list to render efficiently as our catalog grows
