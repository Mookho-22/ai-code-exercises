React DevTools output:

Warning: Encountered two children with the same key, `1`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted â€” the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version.

Performance analysis:

Rendering performance issue detected:
- Component re-rendering too frequently
- Inefficient DOM updates detected
- Key prop warnings contribute to update inefficiency

React profiler shows:
- Unnecessary re-renders of MovieList component
- Extra work in reconciliation phase due to missing/duplicate keys
- Potential memory leaks due to component identity issues
